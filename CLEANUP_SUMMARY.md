# Cleanup Actions Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Date-specific CSV files moved to archive**
   - Moved all `garmin_stats_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` files to `exports/archive/` directory
   - This maintains the data while keeping the main exports directory clean
   - New data is now automatically archived by date

2. **Enhanced date information in CSV files**
   - Added explicit date fields (year, month, day, day_of_week)
   - Original date field preserved for backward compatibility
   - Dated CSV files automatically created in `exports/archive/` directory

3. **Standardized root-level Python files**
   - Made `daily_export.py` a symlink to `src/daily_export.py` 
   - This matches the pattern used by `downloader.py`, which was already a symlink
   - Ensures all code changes happen in the src directory

4. **Created src/exports directory**
   - Added this directory to maintain consistency with the project structure
   - This ensures the export path is available in both locations

5. **Removed temporary/backup files**
   - Cleaned up any `.bak` files

## Project Structure

The project now has a cleaner structure with:

1. Root level launcher scripts and symlinks for backward compatibility
2. Main functionality in the `/src` directory
3. Tests in the `/tests` directory
4. Current data in the main CSV file, with historic date-specific files archived

## Benefits

1. **Simpler maintenance**: All core code is in the src directory
2. **Cleaner file structure**: No duplicate executables or code files
3. **Better organization**: CSV files properly archived
4. **Preserved compatibility**: Backward compatibility maintained through symlinks

These changes make the codebase more maintainable while preserving all functionality and data.

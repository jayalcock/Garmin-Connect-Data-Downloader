# Health Data Date Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem
Health statistics download was downloading yesterday's data instead of today's data by default.

## Root Cause
The CLI command in `garmin_cli.py` was defaulting to yesterday's date when no specific date was provided:

```python
# OLD CODE (line 587)
start_date = date.today() - timedelta(days=1)  # Defaulted to YESTERDAY
```

## Solution
Updated the CLI default date logic to use today instead of yesterday:

```python
# NEW CODE (line 587)  
start_date = date.today()  # Now defaults to TODAY
```

## Impact
- ✅ **CLI**: Now defaults to today's date when no date is specified
- ✅ **Web App**: Already was using today's date (no change needed)
- ✅ **Shell Script**: Will now download today's data first, with yesterday as fallback
- ✅ **Consistency**: Both CLI and web interface now use the same default date logic

## Testing
Date logic verification:
- CLI defaults to: `2025-05-31` (today)
- Web App defaults to: `2025-05-31` (today)  
- Both systems consistent: ✅

## Files Modified
- `/Users/jay/Projects/Garmin Apps/Data download/garmin_cli.py` (line 587)

## Behavior
1. **Default behavior**: Downloads today's health data
2. **Fallback behavior**: If today's data is not available, script falls back to yesterday
3. **Manual override**: Users can still specify any date using the `--date` parameter

This fix ensures that health statistics download retrieves the most current data available while maintaining backward compatibility and fallback functionality.

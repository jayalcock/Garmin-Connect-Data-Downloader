# Summary of Changes: CSV File Storage Consolidation

## Changes Implemented

1. **Modified CSV Data Storage Approach**
   - Changed from creating date-specific files (`garmin_stats_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`) to using a single CSV file (`garmin_stats.csv`)
   - Each row in the CSV file represents data for a specific date
   - Existing date-specific files are automatically merged into the consolidated file
   - Original date-specific files are preserved in an `archive` directory

2. **Enhanced Backup Strategy**
   - Added daily timestamped backups to Nextcloud (`garmin_stats_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)
   - Main file is continuously updated with new rows as data is collected
   - Ensures both data preservation and efficient storage

3. **Created Utility Scripts**
   - Added `merge_csv_files.py` to consolidate existing CSV files
   - Updated the test suite to work with the new file naming convention
   - Fixed the `test_data_retrieval.py` file for better test organization

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `CSV_STORAGE_CHANGES.md` to document the changes
   - Updated the main `README.md` with information about the new data structure
   - Added instructions for users with legacy data

## Benefits

1. **Easier Data Analysis**
   - All data is in a single file, making trend analysis simpler
   - No need to combine multiple files for analysis or reporting

2. **More Efficient Storage**
   - Headers are stored only once, reducing redundancy
   - Reduces the number of files in the exports directory

3. **Better Backup Protection**
   - Daily backup copies in Nextcloud provide point-in-time recovery options
   - Original files are preserved in an archive directory

4. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - The system continues to work with existing code that expects CSV files
   - Migration path provided for users with existing data

## Next Steps

Some tests are still failing due to mock issues with authentication, but these are unrelated to the CSV storage changes and can be addressed separately if needed. The core functionality for storing all data in a single CSV file is working as expected.
